# Neeed Foood
This is the source for the simple Neeed Foood app. Neeed Foood is a simple responsive site that allows users to quickly find recipes based on the course, cuisine and time available to cook.

# Contributing
This is really a sample application, but if you want to use this for whatever reason, here's what you'll need to get up and running developing.

## Install Node modules
```npm install```

## Install Bower components
```bower install```

## Grunt
I'm using Grunt to compile the Sass, hint the JS and add vendor prefixes. `grunt watch` is set up to watch all the `*.scss` files, as well as the single `app.js`.
